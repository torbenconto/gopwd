portable way to store and manage your passwords.

## Installation Guide

For the first class installation (unix only), `go` and `make` are required.

First install `gpg` if it isn't already installed. For windows users you can
download ![Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org/get-gpg4win.html).

To install and use `gopwd`, follow the steps below:

### First class installation (auto completions) (unix only)

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torbenconto/gopwd/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Easy Installation

```

## Manual Installation

### Step 1: Download the Binary

1. Go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/torbenconto/gopwd/releases) for `gopwd`.
2. Locate the release version you want to install. For example, v1.0.2.
3. Download the binary file suitable for your operating system. Choose the appropriate file based on your system
   architecture (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit) and operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows).

### Step 2: Extract the Binary (if necessary)

if you used a system package like a .deb or .rpm this is not necessary, the package manager will take care of this for
you.
If you downloaded a compressed archive file (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`), extract its contents to a directory of your
choice.

### Step 3: Add the Binary to Your System's Path

if you used a system package like a .deb or .rpm this is not necessary, the package manager will take care of this for
you.
To use `gopwd` from anywhere on your system, you need to add the binary file to your system's executable path.

**Linux and macOS:**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the binary file.
3. Use the following command to move the binary to a directory in your system's PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):

   ```bash
   sudo mv gopwd /usr/bin/
   ```

   Enter your password when prompted.

**Windows:**

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the directory where you extracted the binary file.
2. Right-click on the `gopwd.exe` file and select "Cut" from the context menu.
3. Press `Win + X` and select "System" from the menu.
4. In the System window, click on "Advanced system settings" on the left.
5. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
6. In the "System variables" section, scroll down and select the "Path" variable.
7. Click on the "Edit" button.
8. In the "Edit Environment Variable" window, click on the "New" button.
9. Paste the path to the directory where you extracted the `gopwd.exe` file.
10. Click "OK" on all windows to save the changes.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

To verify that `gopwd` is installed correctly, open a new terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
gopwd help
```

If the installation was successful, you should see commands `gopwd` printed on the screen.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed `gopwd` on your system. You can now start using it to manage your
passwords.

## Initializing a Vault

To initialize a vault, use the following command:

```
gopwd init [-p <path>]
```

- `-p` (optional): Specify the path to the vault (default: `$HOME/.gopwd/vault`).

**Example:**

```
gopwd init -p /home/'your username'/vault
```

This command initializes a vault at `/home/'your username'/vault`.

You can change the config settings anytime using the above commands.

## Commands

### Inserting a Password

To insert a password into your vault for a specific service, use the following command:

```
gopwd insert <service> 
```

- `<service>`: Specify the service for which the password is used. The service name can be anything, including a
  website, username, or any other identifier.
- `-c`, `--copy` (optional): Copy the password to your clipboard and don't show it on stdout.
- `-m`, `--multiline` (optional): Custom, multiline input to the file.

- **Important:** The service name cannot contain spaces. Use a dash (-) instead. Special characters other than a dash or
  underscore are also not allowed.

You can nest the service names to organize your passwords. For example, if you have multiple GitHub passwords, you can
set one as `github/personal` and another as `github/work`. Nesting is optional and is useful for organizational
purposes. If you don't want to use this feature, simply use the service name as the service identifier.

### Generating a Password

To generate a password for a specific service and insert it into the vault, use the following command:

```
gopwd generate <service>
```

- `<service>`: Specify the service for which the password is used.
- `-l`, `--length`: Specify the length of the generated password.
- `-c`, `--copy` (optional): Copy the password to your clipboard and don't show it on stdout.
- `-m`, `--memorable` (optional): Generate a more memorable password which includes full words.
- `-s`, `--symbols` (optional): Include symbols in the generated password. (default: true)
- `-n`, `--numbers` (optional): Include digits in the generated password. (default: true)
- `-u`, `--uppercase` (optional): Include uppercase characters in the generated password. (default: true)
- `-L`, `--lowercase` (optional): Include lowercase characters in the generated password. (default: true)

Example service names and their representation in the vault:

```
github
- vault
 | - github
    | - password

github/personal
- vault
 | - github
    | - personal
       | - password

github/work and github/personal in the same vault
- vault
 | - github
    | - personal
       | - password
    | - work
       | - password
```

**Note:** The password file is the encrypted version of your password, which will be automatically retrieved when you
run the command `gopwd show <service>`.

### Showing a Password

To view the password for a specific service, use the following command:

```
gopwd show <service>
```

- `<service>`: Specify the service for which you want to view the password.
- `-q`, `--qr` (optional): Show the password as a QR code.
- `-c`, `--copy` (optional): Copy the password to your clipboard and don't show it on stdout.
- `-l`, `--line` (optional): Print or copy only a certain line of the password file. This is useful if you have metadata
  in your files that you dont want copied or shown (or the other way around). When this flag is not provided, the whole
  file is copied or printed.

### Removing a Password

To remove a password and its associated folder for a specific service, use the following command:

```
gopwd rm <service>
```

- `<service>`: Specify the service for which you want to remove the password.

### Editing a Password

To edit a password or add metadata such as an email or username, use the following command:

```
gopwd edit <service>
```

To copy a password from one service to another, use the following command:

```
gopwd cp <service> <new service>
```
